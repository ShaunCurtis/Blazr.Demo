# Blazor.Demo

Blazr.Demo contains solutions that implement my latest **Blazr Application Framework**.

The framework is loosely based on various coding ideologies and concepts.

1. *Clean Design*: code is split into domains.  Each domain is a separate project that enforces rigid clean design dependancies.
2. A Read Only CQS data pipeline.  All data pipeline objects are read only.  

1. ....

There are two demo solutions:

1. Blazr.Weather - demonstrates the framework using the standard template.
1. Blazr.Invoicing - demonstrates some key complex object concepts using the classic *Invoice* aggregate context.

Documentation is provided as a set of notes in the Notes directory.

It isn't complete or finished.  But it is useable.

Take and use what you wish.
