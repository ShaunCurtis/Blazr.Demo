# Blazr.Demo

This is the new repository for the latest version of my Blazor Demo Database application.

The documentation is divided into a set of articles that cover various aspects and key technologies used in the solution.

Articles:

1. [The application Data](./documents/data.md) descibes the basic data architecture, database and test data sets.

2. [The CQS Data Pipeline](./documents/CQS-Data-Pipeline.md) descibes a generic CQS pattern data pipeline.

3. [View Services](./documents/ViewServices.md) descibes the views that provide data services for the UI.

More detail to be added soon!
