# Blazor.Demo

Blazr.Demo is a Repo that contains a solution that implements my latest incarnation of the **Blazr Application Framework**.

The framework is loosely based on various coding ideologies and concepts.  It follows *Clean Design* principles and splits domains into separate project to enforce rigid dependancies.

Documentation is provided as a set of notes in the Notes directory.

It isn't complete or finished.  But it is useable.

Take and use what you wish.

**Please**:  

> If you're using it in a commercial setting, get your organisation to make a specifc donation to a charity for it's usage.

> It doesn't matter how much, or where.  It will make a difference, and I will have made a [very small] contribution to making the world a better place.
