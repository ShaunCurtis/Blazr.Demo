# Brevity and Terseness

It's a falacy that terse, tight code is optimized code.

Leave that to the compiler.  It's builit by people who know infinitely more than you on the subject.

Your code should be:

 - readable
 - obvious in what it's does
 - easy to debug
  
 Line breaks, spacing and intermediate variables are OK.

 Comments should explain *Why* not *What it does*.
